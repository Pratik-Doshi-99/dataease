# DataEase - Data Science Simplified
DataEase is a language that simplifies programming for Data Science. It uses easy to understand syntax and compiles into Python. This project is currently a work in progress. This project was started as a final project for the course Compiler Design, taken at UCSC in Fall 2023. It was started under the guidance of [Prof. Tyler Sorensen](https://github.com/tyler-utah).


## Using the language
1. Clone this repo on your local machine.

## Using the Lexer
1. Create a source code file or use samples/Test2.rds
2. Run the lexer inside the compiler_src directory
```
python compiler_src/de_grammar.py samples/Test2.rds
```

## Using the Parser
1. Create a source code file or use samples/Test2.rds
2. Run the parser inside the compiler_src directory
```
python compiler_src/de_parser.py samples/Test2.rds
```
